The <b>Automatic Power Manager</b> for Windows 10 allows you to automatically switch to High Performance mode based on what apps you are running, if none of these apps are running it defaults to Balanced Mode.
How to use
Start up APM and add a program from the running processes list to the monitor list, if your application isn’t on the running list make sure your program is running and click on refresh running processes list button.
Now when you run this program in the future your laptop will automatically switch to High Performance Mode.

<b>Options</b>

There are currently 3 options in this section.

Monitor mode enabled or disabled – Enable or disables auto switching of power profile.

Start up with Windows – This disable or enable auto startup with windows.

Rate Slider – This chooses how fast the auto switching happens, between 5 seconds up to 20 seconds. Default is 10 seconds.


<b>Current Features</b>

Will switch to low powered mode instead of balanced when on battery and no monitored apps are running running.

Notifications when switching power profiles.

Three power profiles required to function properly, (Low,Balanced and High) if any of these don't exist the app will create the missing profiles.


<b>Example use case</b>

Ableton and other apps that require real-time effects can stutter while playing the simplest of projects even though you might have a very powerful Laptop. 
Reason is simple, the balanced profile on your laptop will ramp up and down the CPU core clock to keep laptop cool and efficient.
When doing a task like music production the CPU clocks can’t/shouldn’t do this ramp up or down, this is how the clips and blips happen.
